2- On your page, show alert for the user that say “Welcome to my site”, then show him prompt ask him to enter his name and write to the page  “ welcome + his name”. (Remark what happen to the home page after writing welcome page).

3- Make a function that takes today’s temperature as a parameter, prints: “HOT” if the entered temperature are more than or equals 30 and “Cold” if it’s less than 30 (use ternary conditional operator).

4-	Change the previous function to take 2 parameters: Temperature and Actual feel temperature to have 3 cases:
a.	Prints normal if both of temperature and actualFeel between 25 and 30.
b.	Prints Cold if both of temperature and actualFeel less than 25.
c.	Prints Hot if both of temperature and actualFeel higher than 30.
d.	Prints “Ambiguous, can’t detect”, in any different case.
Can you use ternary conditional operator in previous example? Why?
Can you use switch case in previous example? Why?

5-Make a function that takes Student faculty as a parameter, checks:
a.	If the entered faculty: FCI, show message: “You’re eligible to Programing tracks”.
b.	If the entered faculty: Engineering, show message: “You’re eligible to Network and Embedded tracks”.
c.	If the entered faculty: Commerce, show message: “You’re eligible to ERP and Social media tracks”.
d.	For any other faculty, show message: “You’re eligible to SW fundamentals track”.
(Use switch(). And why it’s better in that case?).
